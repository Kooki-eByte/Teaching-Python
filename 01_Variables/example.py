# To make a comment in python we use the hashtag symbol

# To make a variable you create a statement with just a name and then have the name be assigned to a value (data type)
# name = 5

# print(name)

# This will not work because python does not have string conjugation
newName = "Cristian" + str(5)

print(newName)

# This is known as the printf function
# print(f"Hello my name is {name}!")
